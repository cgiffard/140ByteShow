140ByteShow
===========

A JS slideshow/slide-deck framework in 140 bytes. To prove a point. Because I was
challenged to write one. (By @alexdickson, that mischief-maker!)

### Rules

The 140 byte limit is just for the JS.

It must also be actually usable as a real slide deck. You need to be able to go
back and forward between slides. If you use this utility to present at a real
conference, nobody must know (unless you tell them, of course.)

### Known issues

*	Doesn't set a slide on load. This means you have to put the first slide class
	in the html tag. Not a big deal, but if it can be somehow incorporated, that'd
	be awesome.
	
### In all seriousness

Slideshow frameworks are too big. If you want a marginally more practical, (but
still tiny) framework, try my own [50Lines](http://github.com/cgiffard/50Lines).
