140ByteShow
===========

A JS slideshow/slide-deck framework in <140 bytes. (Currently 110.) To prove a point.
Because I was challenged to write one. (By @alexdickson, that mischief-maker!)

**[See it in Action!](http://rawgithub.com/cgiffard/140ByteShow/master/index.html)**

Right arrow advances the slides, any other key returns to the previous slide.

### Rules

The 140 byte limit is just for the JS.

It must also be actually usable as a real slide deck. You need to be able to go
back and forward between slides. If you use this utility to present at a real
conference, nobody must know (unless you tell them, of course.)

### Known issues

*	**FIXED!** ~~Doesn't set a slide on load. This means you have to put the first slide class
	in the html tag. Not a big deal, but if it can be somehow incorporated, that'd
	be awesome.~~

### In all seriousness

Slideshow frameworks are too big. If you want a marginally more practical, (but
still tiny) framework, try my own [50Lines](http://github.com/cgiffard/50Lines).
